# @feature-hub/server-renderer

[![Package Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@feature-hub/server-renderer.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@feature-hub/server-renderer)

A Feature Service to manage server-side rendering.

**Note:** This Feature Service is under active development (see

only provides read-access to the incoming request.

[Feature Hub](https://github.com/sinnerschrader/feature-hub) monorepo.**
