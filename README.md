# Feature Hub

The **Feature Hub** is an opinionated JavaScript implementation of the micro
frontends approach, which enables scalable development and cross-page reuse of
end-to-end built features. As opposed to the conventional approach of only
allowing the reuse of UI components without encapsulated business logic, where
many features had to be developed end-to-end several times.

## Documentation

For more information, please refer to the [documentation][documentation].

## Contributing

The main purpose of this monorepo is to further develop the Feature Hub. It is
developed in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for
contributing bugfixes and improvements.

To get started, install the dependencies and run the tests:

```sh
yarn && yarn test
```

### Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of
Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating in this project you agree to abide
by its terms.

### Development Scripts

- `yarn watch:test` — Watches all tests.
  - `yarn watch:test:unit` — Watches only unit tests.
  - `yarn watch:test:integration` — Watches only integration tests.
- `yarn watch:compile` — Watches all sources.
- `yarn watch:demo <demo-name>` — Watches the given
  [demo][demos-package-getting-started].
- `yarn watch:website` — Watches the website.
- `yarn test` — Executes all tests.
- `yarn compile` — Compiles all sources.
- `yarn lint` — Lints all sources.
- `yarn verify` — Verifies non-functional requirements (used on CI).
- `yarn format` — Formats all files.
- `yarn sort-package-jsons` — Sorts all `package.json` files.

### Publishing a New Release

Instead of letting the CI automatically publish on every master merge, the
Feature Hub package releases are triggered manually. To create a new semantic
npm release for all Feature Hub packages, core team members must trigger a
custom [Travis CI][travis-ci] build on the `master` branch. You should leave the
custom config and commit message fields empty.
